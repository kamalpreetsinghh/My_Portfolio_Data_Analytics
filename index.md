### Most Popular Anime in Japan

I want to find out the most popular anime in Japan and their genres, and want to know if anime rating has an impact on the number of viewers.

The dataset contains names, genres, number of episodes, ratings and number of viewers for an anime.

#### Data Cleansing

I have cleansed the data for creating visualization in Power BI

I have selected anime with number of episodes greater than 1 and ratings greater than 8.5
