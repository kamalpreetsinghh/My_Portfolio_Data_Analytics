## Most Popular Anime in Japan

I want to find out the most popular anime in Japan and their genres, and want to know if anime rating has an impact on the number of viewers

The dataset contains names, genres, number of episodes, ratings and number of viewers for an anime

### Data Collection

I have downloaded the dataset from data.world

### Data Cleansing

I have cleansed the data for creating visualization in Power BI

I have selected anime with number of episodes greater than 1 and ratings greater than 8.5

### Dashboard

### Insights

1. In the first graph, I have used a line graph to compare the number of viewers with the anime ratings. There is no correlation between the number of viewers and the ratings.

2. In the second graph, I have used a clustered column chart to find the top five anime with most number of viewers. I have found that Death Note has the highest number of viewers while it has not the highest ratings.

3. In the third graph, I have used a pie chart to find the top five highest rated anime. I have found that the Full Metal Alchemist is the highest rated anime in Japan.
 
4. In the fourth graph, I have used a Area Chart to find the most viewed genres of anime. Action and Copmedy anime are most viewed and horror anime are least viewed by the people.
